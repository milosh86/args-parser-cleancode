JS version of command-line arguments parser (Args) from Clean Code book...just for fun.

"Args is very simple to use. You simply construct the Args class with the input arguments and a format string, and then query the Args instance for the values of the arguments"

Initial module implementation is refactored and cleaned through phases.
